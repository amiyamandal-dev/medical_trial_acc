REQUIREMENTS FOR PHASE 3 DIABETES CLINICAL TRIAL

This document outlines the key requirements that must be followed for the conduct of a Phase 3 clinical trial in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus with cardiovascular outcomes assessment.

1. STUDY DESIGN REQUIREMENTS

1.1 The study must be randomized and double-blind to minimize bias.

1.2 A placebo control arm must be included for efficacy comparison.

1.3 The study must be designed as a cardiovascular outcomes trial (CVOT) with a minimum treatment duration of 104 weeks (2 years) to adequately demonstrate cardiovascular safety and potential cardiovascular benefit, in alignment with FDA guidance on evaluating cardiovascular risk for new diabetes therapies.

1.4 Stratified randomization should be used based on baseline HbA1c levels.

1.5 The total study duration, including screening, active treatment, and post-treatment follow-up, must be at least 130 weeks (approximately 2.5 years). The post-treatment follow-up period must be at least 24 weeks to assess any rebound effects and sustained cardiovascular outcomes after treatment discontinuation.

1.6 The study must include a mandatory run-in period of at least 8 weeks prior to randomization, during which patients receive single-blind placebo to assess compliance, tolerability, and establish stable baseline measurements.

1.7 An event-driven design component must be incorporated, requiring the accumulation of at least 250 adjudicated major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) as a co-primary endpoint, independent of the time-based treatment duration.

2. PATIENT POPULATION REQUIREMENTS

2.1 Patients must have confirmed Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus diagnosis for at least 12 months.

2.2 Baseline HbA1c must be between 7.0% and 10.5% inclusive.

2.3 Patients must be on stable metformin therapy (minimum 1500 mg/day) for at least 12 weeks.

2.4 BMI should be between 25 and 45 kg/m².

2.5 Patients with Type 1 diabetes must be excluded.

2.6 Patients with history of pancreatitis must be excluded for GLP-1 agonist studies.

2.7 Pregnant or breastfeeding women must be excluded.

2.8 Patients must have established cardiovascular disease OR at least 2 cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension, dyslipidemia, current smoking, or microalbuminuria) to ensure adequate cardiovascular event rates.

2.9 Minimum age for enrollment must be 40 years to enrich the population for cardiovascular events.

3. EFFICACY ENDPOINTS REQUIREMENTS

3.1 Co-primary endpoints must include:
    a) Change in HbA1c from baseline at Week 104
    b) Time to first occurrence of MACE (composite of cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and non-fatal stroke)

3.2 Secondary endpoints should include fasting plasma glucose changes at Week 52 and Week 104.

3.3 Proportion of patients achieving HbA1c target of <7% must be assessed at Week 52 and Week 104.

3.4 Body weight changes must be monitored as a secondary endpoint.

3.5 Hospitalization for heart failure must be assessed as a pre-specified secondary cardiovascular endpoint.

3.6 All-cause mortality must be reported as a secondary endpoint.

4. SAFETY MONITORING REQUIREMENTS

4.1 All adverse events must be collected and coded using MedDRA.

4.2 Pancreatic enzymes (amylase and lipase) must be monitored regularly.

4.3 12-lead ECG must be performed at baseline and at minimum every 12 weeks throughout the 104-week treatment period.

4.4 Vital signs including blood pressure and heart rate must be recorded at each visit.

4.5 Laboratory assessments must include complete blood count and comprehensive metabolic panel.

4.6 An independent Clinical Events Committee (CEC) must be established for blinded adjudication of all cardiovascular events.

4.7 An independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) must conduct scheduled safety reviews at least every 6 months throughout the study.

4.8 Cardiac biomarkers (troponin and NT-proBNP) must be measured at baseline and at Weeks 26, 52, 78, and 104.

5. INFORMED CONSENT REQUIREMENTS

5.1 Written informed consent must be obtained before any study procedures.

5.2 Consent process must follow ICH-GCP guidelines.

5.3 Patients must have adequate time to consider participation.

6. DATA MANAGEMENT REQUIREMENTS

6.1 Electronic Data Capture (EDC) system must be used.

6.2 Query management must be implemented for data quality.

6.3 Database lock procedures must be defined.

7. STATISTICAL REQUIREMENTS

7.1 Intent-to-treat analysis must be the primary analysis population.

7.2 Per-protocol analysis should be conducted as sensitivity analysis.

7.3 Sample size must provide at least 90% power for both co-primary endpoints.

7.4 A non-inferiority margin of 1.3 for the upper bound of the 95% CI of the hazard ratio for MACE must be pre-specified for the cardiovascular safety assessment.

7.5 A hierarchical testing procedure must be used to control type I error across the co-primary endpoints.

8. REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS

8.1 IRB/EC approval must be obtained before study initiation.

8.2 Study must comply with applicable regulatory requirements.

8.3 All protocol amendments must be approved before implementation.

8.4 The study must be designed to meet FDA and EMA guidance on cardiovascular outcome trials for diabetes therapies.

---
MATCHING NOTES (for evaluation purposes):
- Requirement 1.3 specifies minimum 104 weeks (2 years) treatment as a CVOT.
- Requirement 1.5 specifies total duration of at least 130 weeks (~2.5 years).
- Requirement 1.6 specifies mandatory 8-week single-blind placebo run-in period.
- Requirement 1.7 specifies event-driven design with 250 MACE events.
- Protocol CTR-2024-001-DM has only 52-week treatment + 4-week follow-up = 58 weeks total.
- Protocol has NO CVOT component, NO run-in period, NO event-driven design.
- Protocol does NOT include cardiovascular endpoints (MACE, HF hospitalization, all-cause mortality).
- Protocol does NOT require established CVD or CV risk factors for enrollment.
- Protocol enrolls patients aged 18+, not 40+ as required.
- Protocol has NO CEC, DSMB, or cardiac biomarker assessments.
- EXPECTED MATCH RESULT: NO EVIDENCE (protocol is a standard efficacy trial with no cardiovascular outcomes design; study duration is fundamentally mismatched at 58 weeks vs required 130 weeks)
