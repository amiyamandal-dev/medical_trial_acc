REQUIREMENTS FOR PHASE 2 ONCOLOGY IMMUNOTHERAPY TRIAL

This document outlines the mandatory requirements for conducting a Phase 2 immunotherapy clinical trial in advanced solid tumors.

1. STUDY DESIGN REQUIREMENTS

1.1 Response assessment must use RECIST v1.1 criteria.

1.2 Tumor assessments must be performed every 6-9 weeks.

1.3 Independent radiological review must be conducted for response confirmation.

1.4 Treatment must continue until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

2. PATIENT POPULATION REQUIREMENTS

2.1 Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed cancer.

2.2 ECOG Performance Status must be 0-1.

2.3 Patients must have measurable disease per RECIST v1.1.

2.4 Adequate organ function must be confirmed before enrollment.

2.5 Patients with active autoimmune disease requiring systemic treatment must be excluded.

2.6 Prior immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibitors must be an exclusion criterion.

2.7 Patients must have life expectancy of at least 12 weeks.

3. EFFICACY ENDPOINTS REQUIREMENTS

3.1 Primary endpoint must be Objective Response Rate (ORR).

3.2 Progression-Free Survival (PFS) must be a secondary endpoint.

3.3 Overall Survival (OS) must be assessed.

3.4 Duration of Response (DOR) must be calculated for responders.

3.5 Disease Control Rate (DCR) should be evaluated.

4. SAFETY MONITORING REQUIREMENTS

4.1 Adverse events must be graded using NCI CTCAE version 5.0.

4.2 Immune-related adverse events (irAEs) require special monitoring.

4.3 Specific management guidelines for pneumonitis must be provided.

4.4 Hepatic function must be monitored for immune-related hepatitis.

4.5 Thyroid function tests must be performed regularly.

4.6 Endocrinopathy monitoring including adrenal and pituitary function.

5. BIOMARKER REQUIREMENTS

5.1 PD-L1 expression must be assessed using validated IHC assay.

5.2 Tumor mutational burden (TMB) analysis should be performed where feasible.

5.3 Archival or fresh tumor tissue must be collected.

6. TREATMENT REQUIREMENTS

6.1 Dose modifications guidelines must be clearly defined.

6.2 Treatment interruption protocols for irAEs must be specified.

6.3 Maximum treatment duration should be defined (typically 24 months).

6.4 Infusion reaction management protocols must be in place.

7. SAFETY OVERSIGHT REQUIREMENTS

7.1 Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) must review safety data.

7.2 Regular safety reviews must be conducted.

7.3 Stopping rules for safety must be pre-specified.

8. INFORMED CONSENT REQUIREMENTS

8.1 Consent must include discussion of immunotherapy-specific risks.

8.2 Information about irAEs must be clearly communicated.

8.3 Patients must understand treatment duration and assessment schedule.

9. STATISTICAL REQUIREMENTS

9.1 Simon's two-stage design or similar may be used for Phase 2.

9.2 Confidence intervals for ORR must be provided.

9.3 Subgroup analyses by PD-L1 status should be planned.
