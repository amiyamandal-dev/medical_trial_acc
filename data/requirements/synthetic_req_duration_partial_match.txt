REQUIREMENTS FOR PHASE 3 DIABETES CLINICAL TRIAL

This document outlines the key requirements that must be followed for the conduct of a Phase 3 clinical trial in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.

1. STUDY DESIGN REQUIREMENTS

1.1 The study must be randomized and double-blind to minimize bias.

1.2 A placebo control arm must be included for efficacy comparison.

1.3 The total study duration, including screening, treatment, and follow-up, must be at least 78 weeks (approximately 18 months) to adequately assess long-term glycemic durability and sustained treatment effect.

1.4 Stratified randomization should be used based on baseline HbA1c levels.

1.5 The active treatment period must be at least 52 weeks, followed by a minimum 26-week extended observation period to evaluate durability of glycemic control after the primary treatment phase.

1.6 An interim analysis must be conducted at Week 26 and a second interim analysis at Week 52 to evaluate early efficacy signals and safety trends before the extended observation phase begins.

2. PATIENT POPULATION REQUIREMENTS

2.1 Patients must have confirmed Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus diagnosis for at least 6 months.

2.2 Baseline HbA1c must be between 7.0% and 10.5% inclusive.

2.3 Patients must be on stable metformin therapy (minimum 1500 mg/day) for at least 8 weeks.

2.4 BMI should be between 25 and 45 kg/m².

2.5 Patients with Type 1 diabetes must be excluded.

2.6 Patients with history of pancreatitis must be excluded for GLP-1 agonist studies.

2.7 Pregnant or breastfeeding women must be excluded.

3. EFFICACY ENDPOINTS REQUIREMENTS

3.1 Primary endpoint must be change in HbA1c from baseline at Week 78 (end of extended observation period).

3.2 Key secondary endpoint must be change in HbA1c from baseline at Week 52 (end of active treatment).

3.3 Secondary endpoints should include fasting plasma glucose changes at Week 52 and Week 78.

3.4 Proportion of patients achieving HbA1c target of <7% must be assessed at both Week 52 and Week 78.

3.5 Body weight changes must be monitored as a secondary endpoint.

3.6 Glycemic durability, defined as maintenance of HbA1c <7.5% from Week 52 through Week 78, must be reported.

4. SAFETY MONITORING REQUIREMENTS

4.1 All adverse events must be collected and coded using MedDRA.

4.2 Pancreatic enzymes (amylase and lipase) must be monitored regularly.

4.3 12-lead ECG must be performed at baseline and key timepoints including the extended observation period.

4.4 Vital signs including blood pressure and heart rate must be recorded at each visit.

4.5 Laboratory assessments must include complete blood count and comprehensive metabolic panel.

4.6 Safety monitoring must continue through the entire 78-week study period including the extended observation phase.

5. INFORMED CONSENT REQUIREMENTS

5.1 Written informed consent must be obtained before any study procedures.

5.2 Consent process must follow ICH-GCP guidelines.

5.3 Patients must have adequate time to consider participation.

5.4 Patients must be re-consented before entering the extended observation period at Week 52.

6. DATA MANAGEMENT REQUIREMENTS

6.1 Electronic Data Capture (EDC) system must be used.

6.2 Query management must be implemented for data quality.

6.3 Database lock procedures must be defined.

7. STATISTICAL REQUIREMENTS

7.1 Intent-to-treat analysis must be the primary analysis population.

7.2 Per-protocol analysis should be conducted as sensitivity analysis.

7.3 Sample size must provide at least 90% power for primary endpoint at Week 78.

7.4 Multiplicity adjustment must be applied for interim analyses at Week 26 and Week 52.

8. REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS

8.1 IRB/EC approval must be obtained before study initiation.

8.2 Study must comply with applicable regulatory requirements.

8.3 All protocol amendments must be approved before implementation.

---
MATCHING NOTES (for evaluation purposes):
- Requirement 1.3 specifies total study duration of at least 78 weeks.
- Requirement 1.5 specifies 52-week treatment + 26-week extended observation.
- Protocol CTR-2024-001-DM has 52-week treatment + 4-week follow-up = 58 weeks total.
- The protocol MEETS the 52-week active treatment requirement.
- The protocol DOES NOT MEET the 78-week total duration or the 26-week extended observation.
- The protocol has NO interim analysis at Week 26 or Week 52 (Requirement 1.6 unmet).
- The protocol has NO re-consent process at Week 52 (Requirement 5.4 unmet).
- Primary endpoint at Week 78 (Requirement 3.1) is NOT addressed; protocol measures at Week 52 only.
- EXPECTED MATCH RESULT: PARTIALLY MET (treatment duration met, but total duration, extended observation, and interim analyses not met)
