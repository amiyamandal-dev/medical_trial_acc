REQUIREMENTS FOR PHASE 3 DIABETES CLINICAL TRIAL

This document outlines the key requirements that must be followed for the conduct of a Phase 3 clinical trial in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.

1. STUDY DESIGN REQUIREMENTS

1.1 The study must be randomized and double-blind to minimize bias.

1.2 A placebo control arm must be included for efficacy comparison.

1.3 The study duration must be at least 52 weeks to assess long-term glycemic control.

1.4 Stratified randomization should be used based on baseline HbA1c levels.

1.5 The treatment period must span a minimum of 52 weeks, with an additional follow-up period of at least 4 weeks post-treatment.

2. PATIENT POPULATION REQUIREMENTS

2.1 Patients must have confirmed Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus diagnosis for at least 6 months.

2.2 Baseline HbA1c must be between 7.0% and 10.5% inclusive.

2.3 Patients must be on stable metformin therapy (minimum 1500 mg/day) for at least 8 weeks.

2.4 BMI should be between 25 and 45 kg/m².

2.5 Patients with Type 1 diabetes must be excluded.

2.6 Patients with history of pancreatitis must be excluded for GLP-1 agonist studies.

2.7 Pregnant or breastfeeding women must be excluded.

3. EFFICACY ENDPOINTS REQUIREMENTS

3.1 Primary endpoint must be change in HbA1c from baseline at the end of the treatment period (Week 52 or later).

3.2 Secondary endpoints should include fasting plasma glucose changes.

3.3 Proportion of patients achieving HbA1c target of <7% must be assessed.

3.4 Body weight changes must be monitored as a secondary endpoint.

4. SAFETY MONITORING REQUIREMENTS

4.1 All adverse events must be collected and coded using MedDRA.

4.2 Pancreatic enzymes (amylase and lipase) must be monitored regularly.

4.3 12-lead ECG must be performed at baseline and key timepoints.

4.4 Vital signs including blood pressure and heart rate must be recorded at each visit.

4.5 Laboratory assessments must include complete blood count and comprehensive metabolic panel.

5. INFORMED CONSENT REQUIREMENTS

5.1 Written informed consent must be obtained before any study procedures.

5.2 Consent process must follow ICH-GCP guidelines.

5.3 Patients must have adequate time to consider participation.

6. DATA MANAGEMENT REQUIREMENTS

6.1 Electronic Data Capture (EDC) system must be used.

6.2 Query management must be implemented for data quality.

6.3 Database lock procedures must be defined.

7. STATISTICAL REQUIREMENTS

7.1 Intent-to-treat analysis must be the primary analysis population.

7.2 Per-protocol analysis should be conducted as sensitivity analysis.

7.3 Sample size must provide at least 90% power for primary endpoint.

8. REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS

8.1 IRB/EC approval must be obtained before study initiation.

8.2 Study must comply with applicable regulatory requirements.

8.3 All protocol amendments must be approved before implementation.

MATCHING NOTES (for evaluation purposes):
- Requirement 1.3 specifies >=52 weeks study duration.
- Requirement 1.5 specifies >=52 weeks treatment + >=4 weeks follow-up.
- Protocol CTR-2024-001-DM has 52-week treatment + 4-week follow-up = 58 weeks total.
- EXPECTED MATCH RESULT: FULLY MET
