TITLE: A Phase 2, Open-Label, Single-Arm Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Immunotherapy Agent IMB-4521 in Patients with Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)

1. PROTOCOL SUMMARY

1.1 Synopsis
This Phase 2, open-label, single-arm study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of IMB-4521, a novel PD-L1 inhibitor, in adult patients with advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have progressed after prior platinum-based chemotherapy.

1.2 Study Duration
- Screening Period: 4 weeks
- Treatment Period: Until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity
- Follow-up Period: 12 weeks after last dose
- Maximum Treatment Duration: 24 months

1.3 Number of Subjects
Approximately 180 subjects will be enrolled.

2. INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND

2.1 Disease Background
Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for approximately 85% of all lung cancer cases. Despite advances in treatment, the prognosis for advanced NSCLC remains poor, with a 5-year survival rate of less than 20%.

2.2 Study Drug Background
IMB-4521 is a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds to PD-L1, blocking its interaction with PD-1 and restoring T-cell mediated anti-tumor immunity.

3. STUDY OBJECTIVES AND ENDPOINTS

3.1 Primary Objective
To evaluate the objective response rate (ORR) of IMB-4521 in patients with advanced NSCLC.

3.2 Secondary Objectives
- To evaluate progression-free survival (PFS)
- To evaluate overall survival (OS)
- To evaluate duration of response (DOR)
- To assess the safety and tolerability of IMB-4521
- To evaluate PD-L1 expression as a predictive biomarker

3.3 Primary Endpoint
Objective Response Rate (ORR) per RECIST v1.1

3.4 Secondary Endpoints
- Progression-Free Survival (PFS)
- Overall Survival (OS)
- Duration of Response (DOR)
- Disease Control Rate (DCR)
- Incidence and severity of adverse events

4. STUDY DESIGN

4.1 Overall Design
This is a multicenter, open-label, single-arm Phase 2 study.

4.2 Treatment Schedule
IMB-4521 will be administered as an intravenous infusion at a dose of 1200 mg every 3 weeks (Q3W).

4.3 Response Assessment
Tumor assessments will be performed using CT or MRI at baseline and every 6 weeks for the first 24 weeks, then every 9 weeks thereafter. Response will be assessed per RECIST v1.1.

5. STUDY POPULATION

5. Measurable disease per RECIST v1.1
6. ECOG Performance Status 0-1
7. Adequate organ function:
   - ANC ≥1.5 x 10⁹/L
   - Platelets ≥100 x 10⁹/L
   - Hemoglobin ≥9 g/dL
   - Creatinine ≤1.5 x ULN
   - AST/ALT ≤3 x ULN (≤5 x ULN if liver metastases)
   - Total bilirubin ≤1.5 x ULN
8. Life expectancy ≥12 weeks
9. Willing and able to provide informed consent

5.2 Exclusion Criteria
1. Prior treatment with anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti-CTLA-4 therapy
2. Active autoimmune disease requiring systemic treatment
3. History of interstitial lung disease or pneumonitis requiring steroids
4. Active infection requiring systemic therapy
5. Known active CNS metastases (stable, treated brain metastases allowed)
6. Immunosuppressive therapy within 14 days prior to first dose
7. Live vaccine within 30 days prior to first dose
8. Pregnancy or breastfeeding
9. Known HIV, active hepatitis B or C

6. STUDY TREATMENTS

6.1 Investigational Product
IMB-4521 1200 mg IV infusion over 60 minutes, every 3 weeks

6.2 Dose Modifications
Treatment may be delayed for up to 12 weeks for immune-related adverse events. Dose reductions are not permitted; subjects requiring dose modification will discontinue treatment.

6.3 Treatment Duration
Treatment will continue until:
- Disease progression
- Unacceptable toxicity
- Subject withdrawal
- Investigator decision
- Maximum of 24 months

7. SAFETY ASSESSMENTS

7.1 Adverse Event Monitoring
Adverse events will be graded using NCI CTCAE v5.0. Special attention will be given to immune-related adverse events (irAEs).

7.2 Immune-Related Adverse Events
Specific monitoring and management guidelines are provided for:
- Immune-related pneumonitis
- Immune-related hepatitis
- Immune-related colitis
- Immune-related endocrinopathies
- Immune-related nephritis
- Immune-related skin reactions

7.3 Laboratory Assessments
- Hematology: Weekly for first 4 cycles, then every 3 weeks
- Chemistry: Every 3 weeks
- Thyroid function: Every 6 weeks
- Urinalysis: Every 6 weeks

8. BIOMARKER ASSESSMENTS

8.1 PD-L1 Expression
PD-L1 expression will be assessed on archived or fresh tumor tissue using the validated immunohistochemistry (IHC) assay.

8.2 Tumor Mutational Burden
TMB will be assessed using next-generation sequencing where tissue is available.

9. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS

9.1 Sample Size Justification
With 180 subjects, the study has 90% power to detect an ORR of 30% compared to a null hypothesis of 20%, using a one-sided exact binomial test at alpha=0.025.

9.2 Analysis Populations
- Intent-to-Treat (ITT): All enrolled subjects who receive at least one dose
- Efficacy-Evaluable: Subjects with at least one post-baseline tumor assessment
- Safety: All subjects who receive at least one dose

10. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS

10.1 Informed Consent
Written informed consent must be obtained before any study-specific procedures. Subjects must have the opportunity to ask questions and must sign the consent form voluntarily.

10.2 Data Safety Monitoring Board
An independent DSMB will review safety data at regular intervals and make recommendations regarding study continuation.

10.3 Independent Radiology Review
An independent central radiology review will be conducted to confirm response assessments.
