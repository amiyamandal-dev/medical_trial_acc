TITLE: A Phase 3, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of GLP-1 Receptor Agonist XR-7842 in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus

1. PROTOCOL SUMMARY

1.1 Synopsis
This is a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of XR-7842, a novel GLP-1 receptor agonist, in adult patients with inadequately controlled Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM).

1.2 Study Duration
- Screening Period: 2 weeks
- Treatment Period: 52 weeks
- Follow-up Period: 4 weeks
- Total Study Duration: Approximately 58 weeks

1.3 Number of Subjects
Approximately 1,200 subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive:
- XR-7842 5mg once weekly
- XR-7842 10mg once weekly
- Placebo once weekly

2. INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND

2.1 Disease Background
Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by hyperglycemia resulting from insulin resistance and relative insulin deficiency. According to the International Diabetes Federation, approximately 537 million adults are living with diabetes worldwide.

2.2 Study Rationale
XR-7842 is a novel GLP-1 receptor agonist that has demonstrated promising efficacy in Phase 2 studies, with significant reductions in HbA1c and body weight. This Phase 3 study aims to confirm these findings in a larger patient population.

3. STUDY OBJECTIVES AND ENDPOINTS

3.1 Primary Objective
To evaluate the efficacy of XR-7842 compared to placebo in reducing HbA1c from baseline to Week 52.

3.2 Secondary Objectives
- To evaluate the effect of XR-7842 on fasting plasma glucose (FPG)
- To evaluate the effect of XR-7842 on body weight
- To assess the safety and tolerability of XR-7842
- To evaluate the effect on cardiovascular risk markers

3.3 Primary Endpoint
Change from baseline in HbA1c at Week 52

3.4 Secondary Endpoints
- Change from baseline in FPG at Week 52
- Proportion of subjects achieving HbA1c <7%
- Change from baseline in body weight
- Incidence of adverse events and serious adverse events

4. STUDY DESIGN

4.1 Overall Design
This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study.

4.2 Randomization
Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio using an interactive web response system (IWRS). Randomization will be stratified by:
- Baseline HbA1c (<8.5% vs ≥8.5%)
- Background diabetes medication (metformin monotherapy vs combination therapy)

4.3 Blinding
The study will be conducted in a double-blind manner. Study drug and placebo will be identical in appearance.

5. STUDY POPULATION

5.1 Inclusion Criteria
1. Male or female, aged 18 to 75 years
2. Diagnosis of T2DM for at least 6 months
3. HbA1c ≥7.0% and ≤10.5% at screening
4. Body Mass Index (BMI) ≥25 kg/m² and ≤45 kg/m²
5. Stable dose of metformin (≥1500 mg/day) for at least 8 weeks prior to screening
6. Willing and able to provide informed consent

5.2 Exclusion Criteria
1. Type 1 diabetes mellitus
2. History of diabetic ketoacidosis
3. Severe renal impairment (eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73m²)
4. History of pancreatitis
5. Personal or family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma
6. Pregnancy or breastfeeding
7. Use of insulin within 3 months prior to screening
8. Known hypersensitivity to GLP-1 receptor agonists

6. STUDY TREATMENTS

6.1 Investigational Product
- XR-7842 5mg subcutaneous injection, once weekly
- XR-7842 10mg subcutaneous injection, once weekly

6.2 Comparator
Matching placebo subcutaneous injection, once weekly

6.3 Treatment Duration
52 weeks of active treatment

7. SAFETY ASSESSMENTS

7.1 Adverse Event Monitoring
All adverse events will be collected from the time of informed consent until the end of the follow-up period. Adverse events will be coded using MedDRA.

7.2 Laboratory Assessments
- Hematology: Complete blood count with differential
- Chemistry: Comprehensive metabolic panel, lipid panel
- Urinalysis
- Amylase and lipase (for pancreatitis monitoring)

7.3 Vital Signs
Blood pressure, heart rate, and weight will be measured at each visit.

7.4 ECG Monitoring
12-lead ECG at screening, baseline, and Weeks 12, 26, and 52

8. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS

8.1 Sample Size Justification
Based on Phase 2 data, a sample size of 400 subjects per group provides 90% power to detect a difference of 0.5% in HbA1c change from baseline between XR-7842 and placebo, assuming a common standard deviation of 1.2% and a two-sided significance level of 0.05.

8.2 Analysis Populations
- Intent-to-Treat (ITT): All randomized subjects
- Per-Protocol (PP): All subjects who complete the study without major protocol deviations
- Safety: All subjects who receive at least one dose of study drug

9. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS

9.1 Informed Consent
Written informed consent must be obtained from all subjects prior to any study-related procedures. The consent process will follow ICH-GCP guidelines and local regulations.

9.2 Institutional Review Board
This study will be conducted in accordance with the protocol, ICH-GCP guidelines, and applicable regulatory requirements. The protocol must be approved by the IRB/EC before study initiation.

10. DATA MANAGEMENT

10.1 Electronic Data Capture
All study data will be entered into an electronic data capture (EDC) system. Data will be reviewed for accuracy and completeness.

10.2 Data Quality
Query management and data cleaning will be performed throughout the study. Database lock will occur after all data has been entered, verified, and queries resolved.
