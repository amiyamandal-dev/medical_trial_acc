TITLE: A Phase 3, Randomized, Double-Blind, Active-Controlled Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Novel Anticoagulant NVX-2090 Compared to Warfarin in Patients with Non-Valvular Atrial Fibrillation

1. PROTOCOL SUMMARY

1.1 Synopsis
This Phase 3 study evaluates the efficacy and safety of NVX-2090, a novel direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC), compared to dose-adjusted warfarin in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) for stroke prevention.

1.2 Study Duration
- Screening Period: 2 weeks
- Treatment Period: 24 months
- Follow-up Period: 30 days after last dose
- Event-driven design with minimum follow-up of 12 months

1.3 Number of Subjects
Approximately 18,000 subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio.

2. INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND

2.1 Disease Background
Atrial fibrillation (AF) affects approximately 33 million individuals worldwide and is associated with a 5-fold increased risk of stroke. Anticoagulation therapy significantly reduces stroke risk but requires careful balance of efficacy and bleeding risk.

2.2 Study Rationale
NVX-2090 is a novel Factor Xa inhibitor with once-daily dosing and predictable pharmacokinetics. Phase 2 studies demonstrated favorable efficacy and safety profiles.

3. STUDY OBJECTIVES AND ENDPOINTS

3.1 Primary Objective
To demonstrate non-inferiority of NVX-2090 to warfarin in preventing stroke or systemic embolism in patients with NVAF.

3.2 Key Secondary Objective
To evaluate the superiority of NVX-2090 over warfarin for major bleeding events.

3.3 Primary Endpoint
Time to first occurrence of stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic) or systemic embolism

3.4 Key Secondary Endpoints
- Major bleeding (ISTH criteria)
- All-cause mortality
- Cardiovascular mortality
- Myocardial infarction
- Net clinical benefit (composite of stroke, systemic embolism, major bleeding, and death)

4. STUDY DESIGN

4.1 Overall Design
This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, active-controlled, parallel-group study.

4.2 Randomization
Central randomization using IWRS with stratification by:
- Geographic region
- Prior vitamin K antagonist (VKA) use
- CHADS2 score (≤2 vs >2)

4.3 Blinding
Double-dummy design: All subjects receive active study drug and matching placebo.

5. STUDY POPULATION

5.1 Inclusion Criteria
1. Age ≥18 years
2. Documented non-valvular atrial fibrillation or flutter
3. CHADS2 score ≥1 or CHA2DS2-VASc score ≥2
4. Eligible for anticoagulation therapy
5. Able to provide written informed consent

5.2 Exclusion Criteria
1. Mechanical heart valve or moderate-severe mitral stenosis
2. Stroke within 14 days or severe stroke within 3 months
3. Conditions requiring anticoagulation other than AF
4. Active bleeding or high bleeding risk
5. Severe renal impairment (CrCl <15 mL/min)
6. Severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C)
7. Concomitant use of strong P-gp and CYP3A4 inhibitors
8. Pregnancy or breastfeeding
9. Life expectancy <1 year

6. STUDY TREATMENTS

6.1 Investigational Product
NVX-2090 20 mg once daily (15 mg for CrCl 15-50 mL/min)

6.2 Active Comparator
Dose-adjusted warfarin (target INR 2.0-3.0)

6.3 Dose Modifications
- Renal dose adjustment for CrCl 15-50 mL/min
- Treatment interruption for invasive procedures
- INR-guided dosing for warfarin arm

7. SAFETY ASSESSMENTS

7.1 Bleeding Events
All bleeding events will be assessed and classified according to ISTH criteria:
- Major bleeding
- Clinically relevant non-major bleeding
- Minor bleeding

7.2 Hepatic Safety Monitoring
- Liver function tests at baseline, monthly for 3 months, then quarterly
- Hy's Law cases will be evaluated by hepatic safety committee

7.3 Cardiovascular Event Adjudication
An independent Clinical Events Committee (CEC) will adjudicate all suspected endpoint events.

7.4 Laboratory Monitoring
- Coagulation parameters
- Renal function
- Complete blood count
- Liver function tests

8. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS

8.1 Sample Size
Event-driven design requiring approximately 396 primary endpoint events. Assuming 18,000 subjects with 2-year follow-up provides 90% power for non-inferiority (margin 1.38 HR).

8.2 Primary Analysis
Cox proportional hazards model with treatment as fixed effect and stratification factors as covariates. Non-inferiority requires upper 95% CI for HR <1.38.

8.3 Hierarchical Testing
If non-inferiority is demonstrated, superiority testing will be performed for major bleeding, followed by stroke/SE superiority.

9. INTERIM ANALYSES

9.1 Data Safety Monitoring Board
An independent DSMB will conduct regular safety reviews. The DSMB may recommend study modifications or early termination based on safety or overwhelming efficacy.

9.2 Pre-specified Interim Analysis
One interim efficacy analysis at 50% of primary events using O'Brien-Fleming spending function.

10. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS

10.1 Informed Consent
Comprehensive informed consent including discussion of anticoagulation risks and benefits.

10.2 Regulatory Compliance
Study conducted in accordance with ICH-GCP, Declaration of Helsinki, and applicable regulatory requirements.

10.3 Subject Withdrawal
Subjects may withdraw at any time. Procedures for safe transition to standard anticoagulation will be provided.

11. SUBSTUDIES

11.1 Pharmacokinetic Substudy
Approximately 500 subjects for population PK analysis

11.2 Quality of Life Substudy
Assessment using AF-specific quality of life instruments (AFEQT, EQ-5D)

11.3 Renal Function Substudy
Detailed evaluation of renal outcomes in subjects with baseline renal impairment
